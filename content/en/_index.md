Discover the benefits of using [Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible) and [Red Hat Application Services](https://developers.redhat.com/cheat-sheets/red-hat-openshift-application-services-cheat-sheet) to build, deploy, and manage multi-cloud application infrastructure at scale. Red Hat Application Services includes a number of Red Hat products including Red Hat [JBoss Enterprise Application Platform](https://developers.redhat.com/cheat-sheets/red-hat-openshift-application-services-cheat-sheet) (WildFly), Red Hat Data Grid (Infinispan), [Red Hat’s single-sign on technology](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on/) (Keycloak), [Red Hat AMQ](https://developers.redhat.com/node/214105) (Kafka and Broker) and more.

- **Consistent**: Ensure reliability with a consistent development and deployment model to create, modify, deploy, and manage business apps in an automated fashion.
- **Flexible**: Implement simple, single-site installations on a flexible platform, with the potential to grow across geographies and platforms.
- **Repeatable**: Write once and quickly install, upgrade, rollback, configure, and scale without manual intervention.
- **Reliable**: Operate and manage large-scale JBoss infrastructure without the risk of manual errors.
